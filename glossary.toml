# This file contains the glossary for the game, which can be access with the G key, in the Help
# menu, or in the quick menu. Each key in the dictionary corresponds to the word being defined,
# and each value for that key corresponds to its definition. The game will automatically sort the
# dictionary alphabetically before displaying it, so keeping the order in this file is not
# necessary.
